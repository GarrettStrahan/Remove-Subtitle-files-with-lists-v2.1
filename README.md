#Renamed Remove SRT v2.0 to Remove Subtitle files with lists v2.1
#Changes this version supports remove .sub (subtitle files) as well as .srt files.
#Changes with Version 2.0 of this program allows the detection of strange character and will process the file even if there are odd character. Version 1.0 would crash and wouldn't output the new text file. This new program works correctly with strange characters
#Python script to process a text file containing a list of movies and it will remove all the elements (the lines in the file) that contains the .srt as the filename extension
#.srt file are subtitle files, if you use the dir > movies.txt to list your movies then this file will remove all the subtitle files out of the text file so you can get a correct count of movies.
#How to use this? Put your movies.txt in this python folder and run the script, then you will get a new file called newfile.txt
#Rename the file how you want and move it where you want.
